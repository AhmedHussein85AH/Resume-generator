#### A Free and Open-Source Resume Builder That Respects Your Privacy

![Build & Deploy]
![Code Style](https://badgen.net/badge/code%20style/airbnb/ff5a5f?icon=airbnb)

Welcome to the front page of **Resume-generator**, a free and open-source Resume Builder web app that focuses on structured data and privacy. The application provides important features such as minimalistic UI/UX, customizability, portability, regularly updated templates, and structured data support. Your personal data remains yours alone.

We're going to use this coveted space to discuss about the features of the application, new changes that were introduced since the release and also other information like how to keep the project running through donations and open-source code contribution.

Let's begin, shall we?
